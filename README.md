## Techniques Used:

## Summary:
My research group and I studied the impact of goal preferences on drinking behavior in 122 inpatient alcohol withdrawal patients. We measured therapeutic goals and alcohol consumption at multiple points during treatment. Results showed a strong preference for unlimited abstinence, which influenced drinking behavior and continuous abstinence. We also observed negative correlations between goal preference and commitment to abstinence.
